java notes:

1. For cloning the GIT repository in local folder, Open terminal, go to the specified folder and ru the below command.
git clone "repository URL"

2. Function - Is used to do particular task.
Java should contain one Main class inside which main function is present. Class is like an container for related Methods.
Funcation inside Class is called Method.

public class Main {
  public void main() {
    ...
  }
 }
 
 3. Below are the naming convention for Class and Method
    classes - PascalNamingConvention
    Method -  camelNamingConvention

4. Package -> Class -> Methods.
    Packages should always end with semicolon.
    
5. Complier & Execution
    Complier : Java Compiler convert the source code(*.java) into Byte code(*.class)
               Java virtual Machine(JVM) convert the Byte code into Native code(Window,Mac,Linux..) can understand, that is why it is platform independent.
               
6. We need to import the class if its available in different package,
    ##import java.util.Date;

7. Prmitive and Reference:
    Primitive - Primitive type don't have members. Will use primitive typr for storing simple value.
                (byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean)
    Reference - Reference as members which we can call using dot operator. Will use Reference for storing complex objects.
                Date currentDate = new Date()
                currentDate.getTime()
8. Obect is an instance of Class - Class:Shapes Object:Circle,Rectangle,Square... Objects have members we can access using class operator.

9. Backslach is used to escape charaters.
